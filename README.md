HW3 for Codepath


*Completed*
---
- Dragging the headline should reveal the menu
- If you're dragging down, releasing the headline should animate the headline to the down position
- If you're dragging up, releasing the headline should animate the headline to the up position
- If you're dragging the headline up past the top, the friction should increase
- Optional: Fade in different headlines every few seconds
- Optional: Dragging on the scrollable feed of headlines should change the scale of the feed (not 100% correct...)
- Added: Animate the Menu (scale and fade in) as it does on the real paper app.
